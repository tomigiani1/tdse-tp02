/*
 * A variable declared outside any function or a block of code is called a
 * global variable. Global variables are frequently used to permanently store
 * data in a defined scope where they can be accessed and manipulated.
 *
 * Global variables do not stay limited to a specific function, which means
 * that one can use any given function to access and modify the global
 * variables. The initialization of these variables occurs automatically to 0
 * during the time of declaration. Also, we generally write the global
 * variables before the main() function.
 *
 * extern keyword in C applies to C variables (data objects) and C functions.
 * Basically, the extern keyword extends the visibility of the C variables and
 * C functions. Thatâ€™s probably the reason why it was named extern.
